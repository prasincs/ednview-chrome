h2. EDNView for Chrome


This was done as a quick hack to view edn in browser. YMMV. The rest of the text from the original text has been left intact.

Uses:

https://github.com/shaunxcode/jsedn

https://github.com/jamiew/jsonview-chrome

h2. Text from jsonview-chrome project 

Formats & syntax highlights JSON viewed inside of the web browser! Yay

*PLEASE NOTE*: this codebase is currently unmaintained, and is unrelated to the JSONView extension "available in the Chrome store":https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc â€“ that said, many people seem to be using it to great success, and pull requests or a new maintainer are always welcome.

A Chrome port of Ben Hollis' JSONView extension for Firefox: http://jsonview.com

You too can enjoy JSON as it was intended:

h2. Ghetto JSON type detection

Chrome doesn't currently support exposing mimetypes to extensions:

* "relevant thread #2":http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/6deeb0f8cf75090a/ae984e9d5897d779?lnk=gst&q=content+type#ae984e9d5897d779

In lieu we're only matching URIs containing ".json" -- rather than running regexes on *every* pageload.

If you don't mind the performance impact and want to try and parse everything, this is a simple change in manifest.json

bq.
	"matches": [ "http://*/*.json*", "file:///*/*.json*" ]
	=>
	"matches": [ "http://*/*", "file:///*/*" ]
